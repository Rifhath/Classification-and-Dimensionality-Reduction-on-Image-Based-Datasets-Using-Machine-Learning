**Classification and Dimensionality Reduction on Image-Based Datasets Using Machine Learning**

**Project Overview**

This repository contains the implementation and results of a machine learning-based analysis on image-based datasets for protein expression classification and dimensionality reduction. The project leverages advanced feature extraction techniques and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and improve prediction accuracy using image and tabular data.

**Key Objectives**

**Data Analysis:** Explore and visualize spatial and protein expression data.
**Feature Engineering:** Extract key features from HED (Hematoxylin, Eosin, DAB) color spaces and RGB images.
**Dimensionality Reduction:** Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for efficient representation of high-dimensional data.
**Model Development:** Train regression and classification models to predict protein expression levels from image data.

**Technologies and Tools**

**Programming Language:** Python
**Libraries and Frameworks:**
**Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
**Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
**Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Image Processing:** Scikit-image
**Dataset:** Protein expression data (spatial and image-based)

**Key Features**

**Protein Expression Visualization:** Histograms and scatter plots for proteins such as NESTIN, cMYC, and MET.
**Image Preprocessing:** Conversion from RGB to HED space to highlight nuclear features.
**Regression Analysis:** Predictive models for protein expression levels based on engineered features.
**Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA for efficient analysis and visualization of high-dimensional image features.
**Performance Evaluation:** Metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE for assessing regression models.

**Results**

PCA revealed the most influential features with reduced dimensions while preserving 95% of the data variance.
Regression models achieved an R² score of 0.85, demonstrating strong predictive capability.
Feature analysis indicated significant correlations between H-channel intensity and protein expression levels.

**Future Work**

Explore advanced techniques like deep learning for image feature extraction.
Implement ensemble learning models for better prediction accuracy.
Extend analysis to include multi-class classification tasks for different protein expression patterns.
